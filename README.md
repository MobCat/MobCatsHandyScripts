# MobCat's Handy Scripts

**[About]**<br /> 
This is a colection of handy scripts I use a lot or just made because i'm lazy<br /> 
These scripts are mostly windows based but there are also a few python things in here too.<br /> 
Each script will have there own readme on what it is and how to use it, so for more info on each script check there first.<br />
